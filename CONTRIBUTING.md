## Development

The code lives in Jupyter notebooks in `nbs/`. Do not modify the .py files as they will be autogenerated from the notebooks.

To export the .py files from nbs/:

```bash
pip install nbdev
nbdev_export
```

## Deployment

To deploy the package to PyPI:

```bash
TODO
```

To deploy the demo to Railway:

```bash
brew install railway
railway login
railway link
railway domain
railway up
```
