## Development

The code lives in Jupyter notebooks in `nbs/`. 

* Add components in nbs/
* Do not modify the .py files as they will be autogenerated from the notebooks.

To export the .py files from nbs/:

```bash
pip install nbdev
nbdev_export
```

To generate the docs locally, run `nbdev_preview` and open the link to the rendered notebook in your browser.

## Deployment

To deploy the package to PyPI:

```bash
TODO
```

To deploy the demo to Railway:

```bash
brew install railway
railway login
railway link
railway domain
railway up
```
