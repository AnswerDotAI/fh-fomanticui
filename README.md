FastHTML UI components that can be rendered with the structure of your preferred CSS UI framework

As a POC, we have a FastHTML `Card` that can be rendered with any of:

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/)
* [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/docs/card)
* [Semantic UI / Fomantic UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/views/card.html)
* [Franken UI](https://franken-ui.dev/docs/card)

## Quickstart

Run main.py from any of the UI framework directories
