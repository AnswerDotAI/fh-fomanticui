# fh-ui

Still experimenting and very unstable.

## Demo

[https://fh-ui-production-1870.up.railway.app/](https://fh-ui-production-1870.up.railway.app/)

TODO:
* [ ] Show all components from 01_pico.ipynb when Pico CSS is selected
* [ ] Show all components from 02_fomantic.ipynb when Fomantic UI is selected

## Background

Currently this is a learning experiment:

* 01_pico.ipynb is from fasthtml/nbs/02_xtend.ipynb, brought in so I can play with it
* 02_fomantic.ipynb is patterned after 01_pico.ipynb, but with Fomantic UI

## History

This was originally a POC of a FastHTML `Card` that could be rendered with any of:

* [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/docs/card)
* [Semantic UI / Fomantic UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/views/card.html)

The POC didn't validate the idea, but it was valuable to learn from.
